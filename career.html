                <p>The Human Rights Campaign is a nonprofit organization that focuses on equity and equality for the LGBTQ community worldwide. Being queer and having personal experiences with the tribulations that many individuals within the community face gives me motivation to be a part of this company. I have previous experience working for a nonprofit organization, in Marketing and event planning, which is useful for their needs. In addition I also have relevant coursework within my education at University of Minnesota Duluth!</p>
