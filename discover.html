        <h1>Why University of Minnesota Duluth?</h1>
        <p> College is an opportunity for many to grow in both education and independence, which is why I chose to seek further education. </p>

                    <h3>Communication Academics</h3>
                    <p> The Communication Department at UMD is one of the best choices for students looking to pursue a career in the relm of Communications, like Marketing, Nonprofit Work or Journalism. The professors mix the two main aspects of Communication, social science and rhetoric theories, to curate the best rounded education.  </p>                    
                    <h3>Distance</h3>
                    <p> Growing up in central Minnesota, Duluth was the perfect getaway for a day trip, being a quick two hour drive. So when choosing a place to spend my next handful of years I wanted to feel independent, but not to far away from my hometown. After settling here I found similarities between Duluth and my hometown, like proximity to the lakes and memorable dining experiences!  </p>

                <div class="hobbies-text">
                    <h3>Beautiful Scenery</h3>
                    <p> Duluth has some unique features that other places do not have. The vast Lake Superior provides beautiful waves, the changing leaves create a colorful backdrop, and the old architecture encompasses the skyline, which are clear reasons why I love the aesthetics of Duluth. </p>
                    <h3>Community & People</h3>
                    <p> What I have learned from living in Duluth is how amazing the people are. I have cultivated an amazing group of people that I get to spend my time with. In addition, there is a sense of culture and acceptance within the community, especially compared to where I grew up. I feel as though the community truly cares about the people here. Because of the size of this city, you can find groups of people that share some aspect of you, like hiking enthusiasts, societal advocates, or bird lovers! </p>
                    <h3>Food & Local Spots</h3>
                    <p> My first time eating out in Duluth, I had a delicious sausage pizza from Pizza Luce. Now that I have spent over a year in Duluth, it has become one of my favorite places to eat. One day, after a tough day in classes, I took myself out for a treat. I meandered my way to Dovetail Cafe, where I had one of the most rich and coziest Chocolate Chai Latte. Now, when I work too hard and need something to recharge, I take the jaunt over and seat myself in the warm cafe!</p>
