                    <p>Lately, I have loved spending time outdoors. Photography has become a passion of mine and have enjoyed taking pictures of my friends and family! In addition to this, I have become involved in our schools Bird Club, leading to more time outside taking pics of native and rare birds! 📸🦅</p>

                    <p>I have had the great experience of working with Smiles for Jake, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness non-profit organization. Within my time here, I learned skills with social media marketing, including the Facebook Business Suite and other Meta applications. I also was tasked to organize and run a 5K race to spread awareness about SFJ's mission! I spend time aswell at community events, communicating one-on-one with the people we strive to support!</p>

                    <p>My experience in Human Resources at Target build my professional experience within corporate human resources. Within this position I was tasked to analyze and organize data relating to our team members. I routinely listened to their needs and wants from their leads and daily tasks. I also organized break room activities relating to the season!  </p>
