                    <p>Photography has always been a hobby of mine. I purchased a camera in September of 2025, and it has taken off! Some of my favorite things to capture are family, friends, and animals. Duluth has been a perfect muse for my photography. Some of my favorite experiences have been taking pictures of my experiences in Duluth, which is also why it is so important to me. Having the opportunity to look back at these experiences is priceless!📸 🌲</p>

                    <p>One new hobby of mine is birding. My roommate and mutual friends got me involved in our UMD birding group. Because of this, I have become proficient in identifying birds native to the area and rare ones migrating through. One of the most exciting experiences I had with birding is when I was able to correctly identify my first bird, a Green Herron. It has given me more opportunities to be outside in nature and which is super important to me!  🦆 🐦</p>
